# Homework 6 Weather Dashboard

https://seafoodude.github.io/homework-6-weatherDash/

## Description

This Homework 6 Weather Dashboard was created for boot camp students who were going through Module 06. It contains a weather dashboard that holds the weather information for the current day and a five day forecast for the city inputted.

My motivation came from my desire to learn about web APIs and apply it in creating a weather dashboard.
I created this weather dashboard to show that I have learned and absorbed the information given to me through the Module 06 requirement from the UCLA coding bootcamp.
This helped me to achieve a foothold in adding more complex and functional web API programs in my future projects.
I learned how to install a web API and build a weather dashboard.
